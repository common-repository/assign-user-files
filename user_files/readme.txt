An administrator can assign files to users, delete links between users and files, and the users can see and download files assigned to them.

== Description ==

This plugin allows an administrator to assign uploaded media files to certain users, with the option to delete files from specific users at any time. The file to user relationship is one to many so more than one user can have the same file assigned to them, and a user can have as many files assigned to them as the administrator wants. Normal users can sign in and see what files are available to them and download them if they wish.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'user_files' directory to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Click on Dashboard to see and/or download any files that are assigned to you 
4. If you are the administrator you can assign files to users or delete file links from users by clicking 'User Files' in the Settings menu
